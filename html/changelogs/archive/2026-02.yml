  - balance: After noticing it was too easy for animals to crawl through maintenance
      by abusing the Easy-Exit sensors, Nanotrasen has replaced all unrestricted door
      sensors (like in maintenance) with a pull-down lever that should take around
      2-3 seconds to engage. It has been designed to allow the employee to actuate
      it despite any pressure differentials within an area.

      of the station, which will continue to use the "older" Ready-Exit system.

      inside the name anywhere the map reader would ignore this value when a map was
